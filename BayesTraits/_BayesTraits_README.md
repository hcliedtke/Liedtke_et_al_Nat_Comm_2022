# README

This folder contains the scripts for running the BayesTraits analysis performed by Liedtke et al. 2022.

The data is divided into three taxonomic datasets: Anura, Caudata, Gymnophiona (gymno). The procedure are similar for all three. They differ primarily in that not all life history modes are represented in each set.

Each taxonomic folder contains at least the following files/directories:

* `_dat_<taxon>.csv` : multi-trait coding for life history
* `_tree_anura_bt.tre` : taxonomic subset of the phylogeny
* `_run_<taxon>_rjhp_cov_r#.txt` : run commands and settings to be passed to BayesTraits. 3 copies of this file exist, for the 3 replicates. They are identical, other than that one of the replicates also includes a stepping stone sampler for calculating the marginal likelihood.
* `<taxon>_rjhp_cov_r#.Log.txt` : BayesTraits output per run
* `<taxon>_rjhp_cov_r#.Schedule.txt` : BayesTraits schedule file per run
* `<taxon>_rjhp_cov_r#.Stones.txt` : BayesTraits stepping stone output.
* `_bt_diagnositcs_<taxon>.R` : auxiliary R script for diagnosing and exploring BayesTraits results.
* `chain1_summary.csv` : summary table generated by the `_bt_diagnositcs_<taxon>.R` script


## Contact

All scripts were written by Christoph Liedtke (with lots of inspiration from many sources, including the package authors of the packages used). for any questions, contact me at:  `christoph.liedtke@ebd.csic.es`.
