# MuHiSSE

This folder contains the scripts for running the hisse() analysis performed by Liedtke et al. 2022.

The data is divided into three taxonomic datasets: Anura, Caudata, Gymnophiona (gymno). The procedure are similar for all three. They differ primarily in that not all life history modes are represented in each set.

Each taxonomic folder contains at least the following files/directories:

* `<taxon>.csv` : binary multi-trait coding for life history
* `<taxon>.tre` : taxonomic subset of the phylogeny
* `_run_muhisse_<taxon>.R` : main R script to run muhisse
* `muhisse_<taxon>.RData` : workspace image containing all data objects
* `muhisse_fit_<taxon>.txt` : exported model fitting results (tab separated table)
* `starting_tries` : a directory containing all models run (including multiple starting tries for each model)
* `muhisse_<taxon>.pdf` : all graphic outputs generated by the _run script
* `best_mod_tiprates_<taxon>.csv` : tip rates from the best performing model

A fourth folder "aux_scripts" contains scripts that are called by the main "_run" scripts. They contain custom functions (`muhisse_functions.R`) for preparing and processing the data, and all of the muhisse models (`muhisse_models_2022.R`). Both are non-taxon specific.


## Contact

All scripts were written by Christoph Liedtke (with lots of inspiration from many sources, including the package authors of the packages used). for any questions, contact me at:  `christoph.liedtke@ebd.csic.es`.
